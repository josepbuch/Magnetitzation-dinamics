You will find the structure of the Convolutional Neural Networks described in the abstract, as well as the data generator program, which generates data using a theoretical model based on FMR modeling.

**Abstract**: Magnetic thin films are the building blocks of modern magnetic memories and sensors. Their magnetization dynamics are typically described by the Landau–Lifshitz–Gilbert (LLG) equation, which is usually solved numerically after spatial discretization, a process that requires considerable computational burden. To reduce this computational load and assist in the characterization of experimental data, neural networks (NNs) offers a promising alternative.
In this work, we employ two deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with different dimensionalities to model ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) in thin films. The training data are generated through numerical integration of the LLG equation and used in a supervised learning framework. The trained models enable the estimation of key ferromagnetic parameters -- damping constant, saturation magnetization, inhomogeneous linewidth, and anisotropy field -- without relying on conventional fitting methods such as the Kittel or Gilbert approaches. Finally, we achieve results that validate NNs as a promising tool for accelerating magnetization dynamics research.
