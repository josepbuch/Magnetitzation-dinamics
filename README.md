**Abstract**: Magnetic thin films are fundamental components in magnetic memories and sensors. To calculate the magnetization dynamics of these film, ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) is typically employed to extract the key dynamic parameters. However, experimental setups often introduce noise and perturbations, complicating the parameter extraction process using traditional fitting formulas. 
 In this work, we propose using a deep neural network (DNN) to model FMR in magnetic thin films. Instead of conventional methods, the DNN will be used to extract directly FMR parameters. The data for the DNN is generated through simulations based on the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation.
